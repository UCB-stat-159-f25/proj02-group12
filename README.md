# Project 2: Reproducibility in Natural Langauge Processing

In this project, we designed and implemented a modern NLP pipeline to analyze real-world political text data and uncover how presidential communication has evolved over time. After ingesting and cleaning the dataset with pandas, we built a spaCy-powered preprocessing workflow that tokenized text, removed stop words, performed lemmatization, and extracted linguistic features. Using these structured outputs, we conducted frequency analyses to compare language across presidents and identify interesting trends. We then constructed both traditional and modern topic models: a TF-IDF–based LDA model using gensim to uncover word co-occurrence patterns, and a BERTopic model leveraging transformer embeddings and semantic clustering to derive higher-level themes. Lastly, we did EDA and completed an analysis for word frequency over time and if the usage of certain words change.
